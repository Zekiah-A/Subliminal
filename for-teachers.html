    <h4>At the rate things are going, there will be no society by 2040, however, in the off-chance that a few humans make it past the absolute bomb (in a literal and metaphorical sense) that the future of mankind certainly holds for us, where the English language has degraded so far that these poems are being used like a holy Rosetta stone, then please attempt to read this message, which we have enclosed for all teachers attempting to study the anthology: </h4>
    Gentle reminder teachers, please do not analyse these poems to oblivion. We would <em>actually like people to enjoy</em> these poems, instead of torturing students by analysing the placement of a comma, resulting in them hating the anthology eternally after. Yes, all of these poems are massive jokes. And no, the word "red" was not used to symbolise the blood of the monarchy in 1066, it was used because the object was red. If you're offended, good.
