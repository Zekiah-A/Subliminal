Hide a life of honour?That person who defeated die Leute, tried end racism,His fate unknown, Major Korean, the Anti-Racist.T'was a dark day, when I realised, he had vanished,Off the face of the Earth.Die Geselschaft, a great enemy, back-stabbed that warriorWhat cave, creek or crevice did he hide, branded as aThreat to society? I grasped a sword and trained, under the waterfall in the Dead of the night, stealing my heart to be full of resolve, To act out justice, restore that myth's honour. The Mythical Major Korean.In those old days, when Stresemann reigned,How we'd all think,I have Weimar, my republic,How I'd want the Kaiser to be King!But now, it seems, we were wrong...The old days, age of slayers are now far gone.Hoonter, Reece, Noct, Major Korean, Speedwagon, Zekiahepic, BarirThose times, am besten ZeitDie Zukunft war nicht zu toll...But the tale does not end, no- not the take of Major Korean,Borne in 1066, borne of blood, brother in battle to the slayers,The un-racist könig.War is coming,a great plight, so, he took up th' mantleOne last time.A final clash of steel, iron against iron,Last march of the catgirl slayers, before stepping into new dawn...Major Korean fought valiantly, but comrade after comrade fell,Bloodshed blood lets more mo'r bloodAnd the ground bleeds red,It was then when he said, as the dawn of the next day set;Tears in his eyes, tired, could not fight anymore,I am sorry, Bushi, Noct, Martin Ligations, Swexys, Gundalf,Barir, Zekiahepic, Speedwagon, Samurai of the Spear, Dark Juice,Juloo, Delta. Solaire, Solar System Man, Reece and all fellowOther Slayer; In order, to defeat this foe, and restore this honour... I must become racism... It must be done, thank you everyone... This truly was an adventure, wasn't it?Then with one final attack, a desperate last resort, a desperate last stand.Major Korean unleashed his last attack, his final strike...All the enemies were slain, at the cost of Major Korean's sacrifice,With a final smile, he faded away, finally at peace, at his end. This was the tale of Major Korean.","pageStyle":"poem-centre-wide","pageBackground":""}
