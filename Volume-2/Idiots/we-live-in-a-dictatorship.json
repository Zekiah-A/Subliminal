{"summary":"","tags":"","cWarning":true,"cWarningAdditions":"","poemName":"We live in a dictatorship","poemAuthor":"Angelos","poemContent":"So this last day of school,When you’ve aced your last exam,Forget those lies and rip off your tie,Tear your school trousers in a pair of ripped jeans,Put your blazer under the guillotine,Till it’s hanging strips of blue and red.Fling your tie against the playground fence,And scribble on the fabric, in black whiteboard pen,Hark the Herald, Hail the woods!Glory to the ‘‘Book of fame’’- Insert a quote of dignity and inspiration- Shut up! You Year Heads of abominationThat’s my quote for you eternally doomed,Don’t like it? I’m fine in the Withdrawal Room.And meet me up with Mr Statin,To teach him the fate of OzyAndy.‘‘Upload a yearbook photo’’NO is my motoFor Google Classroom’s chock full of lies,Waffle, waffle in physics and biology,Mice eat cats and cats eat mice,\"See me at lunch.\" You forgot to circle that anomaly.Respiration is just combustion of glucose,And photosynthesis – just CO2 in a test tube!Don’t bother writing a single bit more,See I told you! One out of four!Your sketchbook's too abstract! Your portrait’s too pale,Unfortunately, It will all have to be a total fail,The sun looks too mellow,You need more yellow.Does it have to glow?Skitzgerald said so!Everything is watched,Did I run? Did I walk?Am I sweating or wet, or smell of ammonia?- Careful, you’ll catch bronchitis and pneumonia!’’- Fuck off you Spazpole and Martin, your boyfriend!For none of you are my Mum or Dad.If you make keeping fit more so of a pain,We will end up obese and lame. (like you)Besides:Those five aside fucking footie fanatics,For each touch, each goal between the coats and bags – just pedantic,You accuse me of only my glistening sweat,But the footie players are the ones, who their seats do wet!Dem never asked me if this made me puke,But my mere morning jog, they rebuke.Democracy is DEAD. Bojo sealed his approval,His head of a mop and his eyes of ice,On parliament did he STOMP twice.SHN – Stay home now! Protect our fantastic NHS!In your fantasy it lies, you idiot, you clown-punk.So resign right now and clear your muck,About your regulations, we don’t give a fuck.Our life revolves around one CT,Oh no invalid! Just the T, no C!Lies, lies, lies, these are all LIES,But we believe themWhy? For the benefit and satisfaction,A pointless endeavor.Of a minuscule fraction! ","pageStyle":"poem-centre","pageBackground":""}
