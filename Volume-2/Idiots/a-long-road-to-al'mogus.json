Beating my back like a brick of lead. Yet I Shouted 'horay', meat for days! On my way to Al'mogus. Fingers blue and black, have left the track. A new track of red, and filled with dread, I finally fall, and smash my head, I start dreaming about Al'mogus. A winding road once lead to a land a far, of wealth and riches, gold and cars. Yet barren bodies of idiots lined it's paths, An American dream of Al'mogus. ","pageStyle":"centre","pageBackground":""}
