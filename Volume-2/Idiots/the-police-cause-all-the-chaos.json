Et-cetera, drugs,Police chasing cars at 140 miles per hour – thugs,For driving how fast, like 80 or 90?Kinetic energy and gears – I treasure your velocity butDem tell me, dem tell me, don’t go more than fortyBut dem chase me at fifty in the pitch-black narrow road.And blind me with their azure headlamps.It’s a game, a playground game!Of cops and robbers,Or perhaps I’m being hunted by a dodgy imposter!20% gradient and the bloodstream’s infused, with ketones and glucose,Now, I won’t ever stop.Suddenly a sickly green witch emerges,From the gutter at the side or the thorny green hedges.It’s not a ghost, IT’S A LIVING MAN!I instinctively clutch the handles of the breaks,And slam them till they’ve melted away.‘‘Are you crazy, ya menace to society!51mph down a road meant for 40?Gimme thirty pounds, you idiot, ya rascal’’Avant and quit my sight you man of idiocity!You sped and chased me with heaps of animosity,Your hand that preys on little innocent victims,And steers right over red lights and zebra crossings,You are the one who ‘‘verbally abuses’’,And your accelerator pedal, constantly misuses.You are the menace, you are the idiot,You deserve the heaviest fine,Therefore, my hard earned thirty pounds are MINE.","pageStyle":"poem-centre","pageBackground":""}
