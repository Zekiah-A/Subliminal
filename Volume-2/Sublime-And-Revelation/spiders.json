Ever. Changes. And is it better that way? As spiders don't need qualifications, certifications, or legislations just to be classed as functioning. They have no need to fit into the jigsaw; of office or labour work, led to make decisions in days, weeks, seconds,  that could change the rest of a life. And it's like that beauty of time, the grace of each gold-crusted cog on a clock that turns so intricately, the heavens and our stars, and the round moon that comes full every so often, is our greatest antagoniser. As we decide on things so crucial so fast, a wrong one causing so much suffering in the end, and a right one causing the same; except just for someone else. Since the world was never truly free, it's all binary. And would one feel any better, knowing that he was free, and the reason that he did nothing to change the world in life, lest the  grass that he stepped on, or the webs that he unknowingly destroyed, was not the fault of the world, but was entirely his naïve decisions? Or would false hope be greater under a regime without choice; at least knowing that while not contributing alone to humanity, he was  part of a grand clockwork, pushing his country further for future generations? It seems like the world decided that we should all be alone, when pursuing our dreams, or just trying to make it better for our descendants. And while the 'unfree', democratically enact their power to disagree, and break away from the crowd. Spiders disagree too. As while millions all descend from the same womb. Spiders live alone, apart, and make a difference alone, coating the walls in fresh sets of silk, and invisibly clearing the pests of our lives. Yet somehow they have no human nature; no feelings of failure when their webs are destroyed, and their legacy blown full. And still, the primitive humans can't shake the feeling that they have failed, unless they cure world hunger, war or some other stupid thing they made. And maybe that's why so many people fear them? And now I wonder; do the spiders even know of the millennia of ancestors that came before them? Or the magic of their web. Or the wonders of the sublime things that brought them in existence? Or are they just living? In the moment.","pageStyle":"poem-centre-wide","pageBackground":""}
