The sky dull blue, grey blending into the horizon, the wind slow, cold, the breeze of the sea. As I trodded on through the graves, hunched, a small shape emerged from the dust. Polished sandy straps of some sort of metal. Cogs exposed through sand-stained glass. And like a gem, oh how it stood out. Preserved like some creature within epoxy resin. Polished like the marbles in a great father's pouch, letting light through, as each hand casts a gentle shadow. And I wondered, at this cold clockwork cogs-a-spinning, intricate dials this had to be created, by someone, as it shines the sun's light in a dull world, it's complexity, in a void of nothing, and pressed on these things, the creator's passions read \"Wine  Inc. Watches\" - And starving it reminded me of bread; I misread. For I realised I was a sinner, denier of the last dinner. For the world was zounds bigger and more complex than these. 5,000 of these watches, polished and clean probably hide here waiting to be seen, and the planets and the stars and the cities and the trees. Who had the ambition to make all of these? I believe, In the Sublime. ","pageStyle":"poem-centre-wide","pageBackground":""}
