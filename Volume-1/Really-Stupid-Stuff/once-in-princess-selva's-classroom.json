They are circles instead. A hundred agonies in icing and jam, From which most kids will pick one or two. But I wander as I wonder right under the desks and remember, remember my insulin levels. Oh come all ye Faithful! Joyful and triumphant This christmas I WON’T give my heart! BECAUSE I’M GLUCOSE INTOLERANT Hark the Herald crisps explode! Glory to, the storm of crumbs! For plastic gifts have been traversed afar The floor is now plastered in chewing gum... So I tell you, my dear friend: On Christmas eve, On Christmas day Forget the sugar, forget the presents, From Santa’s beard should you run away. ","pageStyle":"centre","pageBackground":""}
