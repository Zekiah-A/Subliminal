Police does watch, It just ticked Acht, At misty Mill Hill, At Apex Corner, hat ich ein Fehler gemacht. Green to Amber, I entered last. Or it went red; someone had blundered, \"Where are you going?\", hat er gesagt, To the county, here down under! Wait a minute… \"What colour's dichromate?\" Have a learning dialogue!\" It’s kind of like orangeade, Not green or red. therefore, I rightfully crossed. I aced it in Chemistry, except not really, It’s 8:10 now! Will I make it? How? At the traffic lights, I did a wheelie. \"You stupid idiot!\" Why did you throw, Potassium dichromate on the bright greenol light? In amberoic acid, now I row! It’s eight fifteen and there’s roadworks ahead! The fat-clogged sewer, to amend. Thankfully, it’s greenol, they let me go. That’s my last traffic light, erased from my mind, Yet that treacherous bend and heaping hill, Second by second, the time does kill. Blood will have oxygen, My VO2 is maxed. \"Time is tight!\" Says Ms Whyte. 20, SLOW DOWN! Put on your school gown! To thirty accelerate! Cause Ozy’s at the gate, For uniform slips to release, does he wait. His heart that fed and his hand that mocked, God knows how many detentions hath he clocked. Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four? Perhaps a thousand and a hundred more. \"Mr Ozy, please have Mercy!\" Ten then nine, Martin thought it fine, \"But aerobic respiration has its limits!\" says Miss Tran \"Shut your mouth and move you rat!\"  Or you'll end up under my tyre, flat!  Eight, Now I’m charging at the gate, Seven, six, five, In the car park I dive, Four and three two, It’s clear ahead, phew. One, over the hump, and it’s done… On the 59th second of the 19th minute of the 8th hour of January the eighth, That’s the last student, who made it through the gate. ","pageStyle":"poem-centre","pageBackground":""}
