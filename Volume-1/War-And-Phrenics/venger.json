Oh hell no! Condense it down, into a brick Then burn it over some snail piss! Let the snail crawl, it's on the run, Then mow it down with my machine gun! Get the ashes, that remain, and stomp them into the ground again! My foot is now contaminated, you and i are now related. Except not really, that's a joke, Cut it off, dip it in egg yolk. But now i can no longer stomp, revenge tastes nice though, chomp chomp chomp. ","pageStyle":"poem-centre","pageBackground":""}
