A small lone seagull screeched in a heavenly fury.As it smashed the brains out of a colossal giant.Blood spilling like wine, for each holy creature.After the reckoning, light starts to pierce throughtheir shroud of feather, casting silver beamson the redder concrete, as strange forms offlesh lay dismemberedbelow.Like doves they disappearedinto this light.Fair retributions for our sins,we had forgotten to feed the seagulls.But we don't know that they will return again,tomorrow.    ","pageStyle":"poem-centre-wide","pageBackground":""}
