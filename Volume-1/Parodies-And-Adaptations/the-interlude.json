It was an act of wits and unpaid tickets. Hidden behind the daily mail And bottles of booze, Ticket inspector left, flowing. Leaving behind my borrowed flat, sunlight mist danced through the sewers.

A second sun, bursting through the colossal peaks. A falling horizon, of heat and twisted wire. Their visages turned blood, they lunged.
