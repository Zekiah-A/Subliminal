I tap my fedora and Titlt it; \"Hello M'Lady\". I am met with DISGUST. My curteousness met with a cold spear of shattered ice Looks. I note to myself \"This is what they mean at r/Conspiracy\", \"Liberals all around me\". I then walk to the store \"flipping r/PublicFreakout\" I think, grimly, thoughts as dark as a moderator. At the till I say: \"Can I have my allowance?!\" The manager looks at me and says \"What? You Never work. Never turn up on time. You are a failure.\" My hands scrawl up and icy eyes dart up in a red flash of fury. Veins pulsate and muscles tense. This violates Redditor courtesy. I may get banned, but I speak: ➁ \"How dare you! I have 150K Karma - NO! 200K Karma and you insult me, it's on, I'm a LAWYER! People On reddit know me as Sammy-Toilet 257! Give me the money or prepare to be shamed! I will Post you on reddit on r/RoastMe!\" WTF I hear And am then met with handcuffs. I smile with glee. I can now upload myself to r/TIFU and rejoice with eternal karma and awards! I whip out my phone and prepare to upload, but my phone is snatched. By this man, a basic simpleton, non-redditor! Does he even know I have a r/Reddit premium and r/Beta subscription?! How dare he! \"No phones in prison\" I hear the call of a predator, an imposter waiting to attack me, but I will fight back! I'm a Redditor! I pull out a homemade bomb I handcrafted and used my r/ShittyLifeTips skills, letting out a r/PrequelMemes saying: \"This is where the fun begins\" ➂ My obese belly flops around with the imact of the explosion, shrivelling to dust like a citizen of Pompeii, flabs of iron, molten in implosion, now dead I vent out in anger. TIFU r/ThatEscalatedQuickly Edit: Wow this sure blew up!
