        ❶ <br>
        <br>
        I wake up in the morning and look, I look into the <br>
        Mirror and see a viage, and a shattered mirror. <br>
        I put on my boots and fedora, don my Reddit<sup>Ⓡ</sup> merch <br>
        And set off. <br>
        <br>
        As I walk down I see a woman. I tap my fedora and <br>
        Titlt it; "Hello M'Lady". I am met with <code>DISGUST</code>. <br>
        <br>
        My curteousness met with a cold spear of shattered ice <br>
        Looks. <br>
        <br>
        I note to myself "This is what they mean at r/Conspiracy", <br>
        "Liberals all around me". <br>
        <br>
        I then walk to the store "flipping r/PublicFreakout" <br>
        I think, grimly, thoughts as dark as a moderator. <br>
        <br>
        At the till I say: "Can I have my allowance?!" <br>
        The manager looks at me and says "What? You <br>
        Never work. Never turn up on time. You are a failure." <br>
        <br>
        My hands scrawl up and icy eyes dart up in a red <br>
        flash of fury. Veins pulsate and muscles tense. <br>
        This violates Redditor courtesy. I may get banned, but <br>
        I speak: <br>
        <br>
        ➁ <br>
        <br>
        "How dare you! I have 150K Karma - NO! 200K Karma <br>
        and you insult me, it's on, I'm a <code>LAWYER</code>! People <br>
        On reddit know me as Sammy-Toilet 257! <br>
        Give me the money or prepare to be shamed! I will <br>
        Post you on reddit on r/RoastMe!" <br>
        <br>
        <code>WTF</code> <br>
        I hear <br>
        And am then met with handcuffs. I smile with glee. I can <br>
        now upload myself to r/TIFU and rejoice with <br>
        eternal karma and awards! <br>
        <br>
        I whip out my phone and prepare to upload, but my <br>
        phone is snatched. By this man, a basic simpleton, <br>
        non-redditor! Does he even know I have a <br>
        r/Reddit premium and r/Beta subscription?! <br>
        How dare he! <br>
        <br>
        "No phones in prison" I hear the call of a <br>
        predator, an imposter waiting to attack me, but I will <br>
        fight back! I'm a Redditor! <br>
        <br>
        I pull out a homemade bomb I handcrafted and used <br>
        my r/ShittyLifeTips skills, letting out a r/PrequelMemes <br>
        saying: <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"This is where the fun begins"</em> <br>
        <br>
        ➂ <br>
        <br>
        My obese belly flops around with the imact of the explosion, <br>
        shrivelling to dust like a citizen of Pompeii, flabs of iron, <br>
        molten in implosion, now dead I vent out in anger. <br>
        <br>
